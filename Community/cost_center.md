~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* ah, that dreaded phrase cost center
* short-sighted management does not know how to value what comes out of a cost center.
* they'll cut you to the bone, and then more, trying to "improve efficiency"
* as an example, we had $35k annually going to Slack and I wasn't getting other budget
  so I tried to redirect it to other community needs.
* Leadership said "what a great idea" and took the money back, but never approved any
  of the other budget proposals that came along with it.
* It was so bad that I was literally buying community swag and paying for our Meetup
  account out of my own damn pocket. I felt like an American elementary school teacher.
