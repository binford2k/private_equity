# Input for marketing & sales

![.float_right The business value of devrel](/_images/mary_book.jpg)

* Marketing and Sales both desperately want to engage with your community,
  but they don't know how.
* Community messaging is not something they're used to and you are the expert.
* Community reactions are often a really good way to measure marketing campaigns.
* Sales always needs leads -- make sure to do this in privacy protecting ways.
* DevRel qualified leads are a good way to support Sales. See Mary's book for more info.

As an example of privacy protecting lead generation -- recently Puppet began marketing
and selling to the open source community. Sales really had no idea how to engage and
asked for help. Clearly since I control the Slack space, I have access to all the user
accounts and emails and such. But users have expectations of privacy, and our privacy
policy explicitly disallows using private user info for purposes un-consented for.

Instead of giving them names, I used our community management tool to gather a list of
*companies* that were represented by one or more employees engaging with our community
via slack, twitter, github, stackoverflow, etc. I cross referenced that with salesforce
and removed all our active customers. The result was a list of companies likely using OSP.

Sales took that report, found contacts for each company, and used it to drive a highly
successful sales blitz and now they're rabid Community fans.
