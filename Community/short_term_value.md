# Demonstrate short term value
## Ruthlessly eliminate anything that cannot

* Triage all your programs, not on criticality but on *viability*.
* Don't waste your limited resources on programs that won't be funded.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Your time is about to be compressed more and more and more and more.
* You won't even have time to do the table stakes, much less move the needle on
  anything interesting.
* Transition as much process as you can to working autonomously, even though it
  means losing some of that personal touch that you won't have time for any more.
* And then the programs that won't survive -- no matter how important they are --
  you've got to just pat them on the shoulder, tell them everything's going to be
  all right, and then you let them die.

I wish I could start on a more pleasant note, but this is the grim reality.
