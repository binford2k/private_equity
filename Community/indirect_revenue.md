# Community supports indirect revenue

* A strong healthy community supports activities that generate revenue instead of
  generating revenue on its own.
* Also provides indirect revenue in the form of cost reductions in other areas.
* Eg, the most inexpensive form of tech support is self-service via docs.
  * Peer to peer support via community is an order of magnitude more.
  * Tier 1 customer support is ***another*** order of magnitude more.
  * And escalating to engineering is yet another order of magnitude more expensive.


| Instead of              | Community provides          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| selling product         | a framework for conversations with new and potential customers giving them added confidence in the product. |
| selling support         | a venue for peer to peer discourse allowing customers to solve their problems before involving Support.     |
| selling services        | a force multiplier for PSE deliverables, giving them flexibility to get more done in the allotted time.     |

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* In a highly proficient community such as Puppet's, community experts often contribute
  engineering fixes before they ever hit Support or were escalated internally. We'd get that
  level of support effectively for free on a regular basis.
* I personally inadvertently and unknowingly closed the most important sales deal that Puppet
  ever had. I didn't even know about the deal, but the customer had already walked; they were going
  back to OSP. One of their devops leads and I got into a conversation on Slack and the problem
  he was struggling with intrigued me. I worked on and published a solution to the Forge over
  the weekend and so the next Monday they came back to the table and closed the deal.
* This isn't self-aggrandization; it's just what happens in Community. Charlie's probably
  done the same thing a hundred times. It just usually flies under the radar -- the only
  reason I even know this happened is that the sales rep came and practically cried at my
  desk thanking me for it (and for making him a shit-ton of money, of course.)
