# Community insights

* Your community reports should no longer focus on thing like:
  * NPS (net promoter score)
  * User sentiment and satisfaction
  * Contributions and productivity
  * Community generated content and talks
* Instead it should focus on:
  1. Retention rate
  1. Flight risks
  1. Projects which have contributed directly to revenue.

.callout.lightbulb Reframe everything you can to support increasing or retaining
the community size and anything that can possibly generate revenue.

You say

> Tim spent a lot of time on that concurrency patch and nobody bothered to thank
> him. He's feeling really unappreciated right now and he's been talking more about
> Ansible. I think there's a strong chance that he leaves soon if we don't so something.
