# Community is the foundation

~~~SECTION:notes~~~
And that's a problem, because as you and I both know....

* Every successful company is because of community
  * the car dealership that's been in your hometown since you were a kid is there
    because of the community of customers spreading word of mouth
  * the coffee shop on the corner is there because of the community of live music
    fans who loves the shows on Thursdays
  * facebook got where it is by first building an immense community and then abusing
    and locking it in with its evil social graph
  * shoot, I'm sure plenty of you are old enough to know what I'm referring to if
    I get all sweaty and scream developers developers developers
* especially with a tech company with a ....let's say challenging.... product, that
  depends on users becoming proficient with said product, a community where people
  can learn that proficiency is absolutely critical.
* It may not be directly revenue generating, but without community, the company
  wouldn't survive to make revenue in the first place.
