# Invaluable feedback

* Community users are really good at letting you know when something goes wrong.
  Sometimes they're even polite about it!
* They're also really good at sharing product improvement ideas and such, as long
  as you know how to ask in effective ways.

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

I recommend the (unnecessarily gendered name) *Mom Test* book. It teaches you how
ask customers and users questions in ways that are valuable and actionable.

At Puppet, we used the lessons from this book to build advisory boards to produce
actionable reports about required product updates, whether features are landing
well or not, rough spots in standard workflows that should be improved, etc.
