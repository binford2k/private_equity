# Keep doing the table stakes!
## just be careful how you talk about it

.callout.warning Some things ***must be done*** for a community to continue being
a safe and effective space. You cannot stop doing these things!

* Code of conduct enforcement and moderation
* Managing privacy, such as GDPR requests
* Administrative tasks
* Tracking and reporting on metrics

Be careful talking to leadership about these tasks as they don't see value in them.
If you must, remember to always reinforce that they support revenue generation and
keeping the community large.

update that adds flavor to this whole thing.
