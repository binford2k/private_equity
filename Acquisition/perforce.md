# Acquisition

![modified perforce logo](/_images/infinity_butthole.png)

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* In early 2022, Puppet was acquired by Perforce.
* which is NOT what you think it is.
* Perforce is not a version control company
* it's the ghoul of a private equity company that acquired the VCS company and
  parasitically ate it and took on its name.
* Don't feel bad for not knowing that -- it's why they stole the name.
* I mistook it myself. Our CTO called me in to a meeting to tell me and I said,
  and I quote, "well at least it's not a private equity company" and Deepak just
  nodded like "he'll figure it out eventually."
