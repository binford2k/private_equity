# Inclusion vs. Exclusion

![Welcome to the table!](/_images/welcome.jpg)

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* And even weirder is the whole way they defined "community"
* See, there's two ways of looking at community. One is enthusiastically welcoming
  people to the table, and the other is the donald trump style of keeping
  outsiders away.
* Puppet was very much the inclusion style. We opened our doors to local events, we
  invited community to show up for things like All Day DevOps watch parties, we
  invited alumni to company celebrations. One year I did a training plan and we
  invited PuppetConf attendees to run the Portland Marathon with us, and so on.
* Inclusion was our default -- in the early days, all "internal" developer chatter
  was on a public IRC channel and community was always welcome to participate.
* I'm sure you can guess what Perforce was. They genuinely thought that excluding
  people made us feel like the "in-crowd" and honestly it just made us not want
  to be there.
* Event attendance was abysmal and we stopped engaging with community both
  internally and externally.
