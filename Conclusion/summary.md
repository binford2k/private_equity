.callout.meh It's possible to build a resilient community that survives under
a private equity company by reframing everything to demonstrate short term

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* A new friend yesterday told me that my talk sounded like the fail-state.
* And that's a really apt description.
* It can very much keep running indefinitely with that warning light blinking, but
  it's never going to change, grow, get better. It's in its final form.
* It's never again going to be the fun community that Spot described yesterday.
* It will never again be anything more than a resource.
* The best you can do is give your community the tools to be self-sufficient, to
  organize their own fun, etc.
* And then get yourself the hell out of the blast radius.
