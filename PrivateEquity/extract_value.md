* Radio Shack got eaten.
* Sears got crushed.
* Hospitals around the country now offer barely workable services for sky high prices.
* Formerly favorite restaurants are understaffed and dirty â€“ shadows of their former selves

If that sounds like money laundering, it's because it is.

And that might remind you of something...
