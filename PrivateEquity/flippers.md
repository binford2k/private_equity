# House Flippers

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* This is the google street view of my own house; it's out in the Cully
  neighborhood here, in Portland.
* We fell in love with the place and bought shortly before pandemic.
* But the first thing I noticed after we moved in was that the yard grade went
  down from the road all the way to the house.
* That meant that water drained directly from the road to the house and in
  a few short years it would have destroyed the foundation.
* All the windows were subtly different sizes, like whatever they happened to
  have left over. You didn't really notice until measuring for curtains.
* The kitchen window isn't even the right size for the casement and it won't
  close properly!
* The back door fell off less than a year after we moved in and I had to rehang
  it. They'd hung the door with drywall screws.
* Beautiful hardwood floor, but instead of replacing carpet, they installed over
  the top of it.
* Earlier this year, I dug into the walls a bit to run some wiring and I discovered
  that the stairs to the basement were supported by a single 2x4 wedged against
  the concrete.

* This is what flippers do.
* They're not living there long term, they just want the sale -- they got my money.
* Cut whatever corners it takes to make it look better and pump the value.
