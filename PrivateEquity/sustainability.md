# Private Equity does ***not*** care about sustainability

* Private equity companies only care about increasing "value",
defined as book price or what they could sell it for.

| Valuable                     | Not Valuable                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Shipping product             | Test pipelines to prevent shipping *broken product* |
| Shipping flawed product quickly | Accurate product market fit                    |
| Features that wow buyers        | Features that make users' lives better         |
| Customers today                 | Customers next year or the year after          |
| Long feature list               | Useful feature list                            |
| Short term revenue              | Long term sustainable revenue stream           |
| **A large community**           | **A *functional* community**                   |

.callout.meh In short, if your thing doesn't increase revenue this quarter or
impress potential buyers, then it probably doesn't get funded.
