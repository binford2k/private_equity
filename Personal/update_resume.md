# Preparing yourself for inevitability

![.float_right exit sign](/_images/exit.jpg)

* If your job title actually says "community" then you should plan for an exit.
  * Lateral move in the company
  * Or just get out, intentionally or not.
  * Try to build a buffer so you can take time to recuperate. You may be surprised by
    how burned out you are.
* Take autonomous processes to the extreme so that the community can continue running
  after your departure.
* Transition ownership and management of assets, programs, etc directly to the community
  so that they can become self-sustaining.
* Document your processes, with handover docs and all.
* Design a succession plan in conjuction with leadership.
