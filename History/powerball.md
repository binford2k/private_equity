# Early projects were often fun and silly

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

* Powerball was a little Slack app to help manage 24hr virtual hackathons.
  * Each hour it would hand out a prize to someone who'd participated in the last
    hour and currently marked as online & active.
  * Gave people a little incentive to participate and be social.
* Function updater
  * Worked with Product & Engineering on ways to encourage devs to update their
    modules to current patterns -- this one ported functions to the new API.
* Community management scripts
  * build engagement, identify up and coming contributors
  * where people are in the community funnel, etc.

These were all fun, but they engaged people and they were a critical part of what
I did. And they helped me use my skills and experiences of using Puppet to help
level up community members and make them more successful.
