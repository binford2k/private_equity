# Contributor Engagement
## Don't get in the way of people wanting to contribute!

![Trusted Contributor program](/_images/trusted_contributor.png)

* Quality Puppet modules == `Puppet skills * (domain expertise * n)`
  * infeasible for one small team to be an expert on *everything*
* Route to quality is to enable ownership by people who *use* the thing
* Commit, review, merge, in some cases even release rights
* Literally took two years to get all the buyin, legal review, etc

* So why am I talking about these things?
* Not bragging about community wins.
* But talking about things that made the community excellent and valuable and productive
  and fun and... and that no longer exist or have been warped and perverted into
  things they were never meant to be.
* Hackathons? What's the ROI?
* Office Hours? Nah, the engineers have tickets to work on.
* Even the Trusted Contributors has been co-opted. The team that did maintain modules
  no longer exists. Now there's an offshores team that maintains the Puppet Forge,
  parts of the Puppet agent, some cloud services, and in their spare time -- they do
  a little module housekeeping.
* Instead the Trusted Contributors program I built to marry the best of the Puppet
  modules team with the best of the community domain experts has been twisted and now
  the community is providing effectively 100% of the maintainance for Puppet
  Supported modules.
* Which... could be fine if they were transparent about it, but of course they aren't
  or I wouldn't be here talking today!
